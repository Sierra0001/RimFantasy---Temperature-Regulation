# RimFantasy - Temperature Pylons

This mod adds 2 new magical gem pylons that radiate temperature changing aura.

Moderately powerful but costly, they are capable of supporting anywhere from a small storage room on their own, to a large facility when multiple are installed. Be careful though, the energies within the crystals are barely contained and excessive damage will produce a rather spectacular explosion.
