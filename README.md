# RimFantasy - Temperature Regulation

This mod adds 4 new magical gemstone furnitures that radiate temperature changing energy

Moderately powerful but costly, they are capable of supporting anywhere from a small storage room to a large facility when multiple are installed. Be careful though, the energies within the crystals are barely contained and excessive damage will produce a rather spectacular explosion.

### Features

- 2 Crystal Bowls (Cold/Hot)
- 2 Pylons (Frost/Flame)
- 1 Research

### Balance

Gems are intentionally sparse and not easy to obtain through natural means, but they can also be purchased from traders or obtained from salvaging certain objects.

Balance feedbacks are welcomed, please provide context when doing so.

### Compatibility

- Save Game Compatible
- Will not play nice with other gemstone mods without a patch.
